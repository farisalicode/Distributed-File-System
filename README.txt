# DHT

A Distributed Hash Table (DHT) network to help store and retrieve
files efficiently.

## Installation

Go to https://classroom.google.com/u/0/c/NjE4MzQ3ODg5MzYw/a/NjQyMTA1MTM1NDk1/details
, and provided you have access to the classroom, download the zip file
which is turned in. Unzip the file and paste all the content files in an empty
Microsoft Visual Studio C++ project, preferably the 2022 edition. The Cryptopp
library also has to be installed, preferably version 8.9.

## Usage

Build and run your Visual Studio solution, with the Debug configuration and x64
platforms being advised. The DHT should be up and running through the IPFS, referring
to Inter Planetary File System, function called in main. Select the option of your choice
from the menu. You can create new folders with the machine names and copy files in them.
